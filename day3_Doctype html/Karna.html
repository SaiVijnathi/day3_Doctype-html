    <p>Karna, one of the most complex and tragic figures in the Mahabharata, is renowned for his unwavering loyalty, incredible skills as a warrior, and his deep sense of honor. Born to Kunti before her marriage, Karna was the son of the sun god Surya, but Kunti, fearing social stigma, abandoned him at birth. He was found and raised by a charioteer couple, Radha and Adiratha, which is why Karna is often referred to as the Suta Putra (son of a charioteer). Despite his noble birth, Karna grew up facing social discrimination due to his perceived lower caste, which fueled his deep-seated desire for recognition and respect. His character is defined by this struggle for identity and acceptance, shaping his eventual alignment with the Kauravas.</p>
    <p>Karna’s remarkable abilities as an archer and warrior were evident early on, but his ambition to learn under Drona was thwarted due to his social status. Undeterred, Karna sought training from Parashurama, who only taught Kshatriyas. Karna deceived Parashurama by claiming to be a Brahmin and mastered the art of warfare. However, when Parashurama discovered Karna’s true origins, he cursed him to forget the most important incantations needed for his weapons in his moment of need. This curse would later play a pivotal role in Karna’s fate during the Kurukshetra War. Another curse he received, from a Brahmin whose cow he accidentally killed, further sealed his tragic destiny. Despite these curses, Karna’s skill and bravery were unmatched, and he longed to prove himself as the greatest warrior, constantly seeking validation in a world that denied him his rightful place.</p>
    <p>Karna's life took a significant turn when Duryodhana, the eldest Kaurava, recognized his talent and made him the king of Anga, granting him the status and recognition he had always sought. Out of gratitude and loyalty, Karna swore lifelong allegiance to Duryodhana, becoming one of his closest friends and allies. This bond placed Karna in direct opposition to the Pandavas, despite being unaware that he was their elder brother. Karna’s rivalry with Arjuna became one of the central conflicts in the epic, as both were supreme archers vying for greatness. Karna’s sense of duty to Duryodhana led him to side with the Kauravas during the Kurukshetra War, even though his heart often conflicted with his actions. His tragic dilemma deepened when Krishna revealed his true lineage to him before the war, offering him the chance to join the Pandavas. However, Karna, bound by loyalty and a sense of honor, chose to remain loyal to Duryodhana, fully aware of the cost.</p>
    <p>During the Kurukshetra War, Karna proved his valor time and again, inflicting significant losses on the Pandava army. His much-anticipated duel with Arjuna became one of the war’s most iconic moments. Despite his superior skills, Karna’s fate was sealed by the curses he carried, particularly when his chariot wheel became stuck in the ground, as foretold by Parashurama. In this moment of vulnerability, Arjuna, at Krishna’s urging, shot the fatal arrow, killing Karna. After his death, Karna’s true identity was revealed, and the Pandavas, especially Yudhishthira, were devastated by the knowledge that Karna was their elder brother. Karna’s life is a study in contrasts—noble by birth, yet denied his rightful place; a great warrior, yet cursed by fate; loyal to a friend, yet fighting against his own family. His unwavering loyalty, tragic destiny, and complex moral choices make him one of the most compelling and heroic figures in the Mahabharata.</p>
