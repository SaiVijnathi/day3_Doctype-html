    <p>Bhima, the second Pandava brother in the Mahabharata, is known for his immense physical strength, fierce loyalty, and protective nature towards his family. Born to Kunti through the blessings of the wind god Vayu, Bhima’s superhuman strength becomes evident from a young age, and he grows into a formidable warrior. He is particularly close to his elder brother, Yudhishthira, and younger brother, Arjuna, often serving as the protector of the Pandavas in times of danger. Bhima's relationship with his cousins, the Kauravas, is marked by enmity, especially with Duryodhana, who harbors jealousy and hatred towards Bhima due to his strength and influence. From early childhood, Bhima’s physical prowess intimidates the Kauravas, and Duryodhana attempts multiple times to eliminate him, most notably by poisoning him and trying to drown him in the Ganges.</p>
    <p>Throughout the epic, Bhima’s bravery and ferocity are demonstrated in various battles, particularly during the Pandavas’ exile. His hunger for justice and revenge is most evident in his promise to Draupadi after her humiliation in the Kaurava court. Bhima vows to kill Dushasana and drink his blood for dragging Draupadi by her hair, and to break Duryodhana’s thigh, which he insulted her with during the dice game. Bhima’s strength is also a key asset during the Pandavas' time in exile, where he defeats numerous powerful demons, including Hidimba, whom he kills before marrying her sister, Hidimbi, with whom he has a son, Ghatotkacha. His role as protector and enforcer of the Pandavas’ justice is further highlighted when he kills the demon Bakāsura, freeing a village from his terror.</p>
    <p>Bhima's defining moment comes during the Kurukshetra War, where his fury is unleashed against the Kauravas. He single-handedly kills 100 Kauravas, fulfilling his vow of vengeance. Bhima's climactic duel with Duryodhana is one of the most iconic moments in the war. Though Duryodhana is a skilled warrior, Bhima uses his superior strength and strikes Duryodhana’s thigh with his mace, defeating him as promised. However, this act of hitting below the waist is seen as dishonorable, and it creates a moral conflict for Bhima, who values honor but is bound by his oath to Draupadi. Bhima’s actions throughout the war highlight his role as the Pandavas' most fearsome warrior, always driven by loyalty, justice, and the protection of his family.</p>
    <p>Despite his ferocity in battle, Bhima also has a softer, more compassionate side. His deep love for his brothers, especially Yudhishthira, is evident throughout the epic. He respects Yudhishthira’s wisdom and always stands by him, even when he disagrees with some of Yudhishthira’s decisions, such as the dice game. Bhima’s love for his family extends to his protectiveness over Draupadi, whom he treats with immense respect. After the Pandavas’ victory in the Kurukshetra War, Bhima continues to play a vital role in the establishment of Yudhishthira’s just rule. Eventually, like his brothers, Bhima undertakes the Mahaprasthana, the final journey towards the Himalayas, but he is the second to fall during the journey, burdened by his attachment to his strength and power. Bhima’s legacy as a fearless warrior, a loyal brother, and a champion of justice endures in Indian mythology.</p>
